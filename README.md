NFL athletes, especially quarterbacks, do not usually progress in a predictable manner. They have slumps, they sustain an injury, or they have the game of their career. Although sports analysts of professional teams often look at player statistics, I decided to take a more athletic ability as opposed to sport-specific approach.

Using raw data from the past several NFL seasons, this script matches starting quarterbacks of professional football teams with their respective NFL Combine metrics to see if athletic ability is a good predictor of Quarterback Rating (QBR), a proprietary statistic created by ESPN in 2011 to measure the performance of quarterbacks in American football. It incorporates all of a quarterback's contributions to winning, including how he impacts the game on passes, rushes, turnovers, and penalties.
